This version of implementation uses the tensorflow API of DataGenerators which auto generators the labels based on the heriarchy of the data, for ex. images for CATs and DOGs are stored in separate folders.

Model is compiled and trained using keras.models API

A subset of data (of 2000 train images and 1000 validation images) is provided in the Data/cats_and_dogs_filtered sub-directory.
